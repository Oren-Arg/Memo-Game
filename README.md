"# Memo-Game"
This is a memory game project done with JS, HTML, CSS.
I focused more on functionality rather than styling on this one.


Open "entry.html" first, enter players names without any white spaces and then you'll be redirected to the game page.
 PLayer 1 will start first.
Each player takes 1 turn.
